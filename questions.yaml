\f0\fs24 \cf0 task: >\
  You have been given human pericyte bulk RNA-seq data comparing Hypoxia vs Normoxia\
  (single-end, 4 samples: Hyp1, Hyp2, Norm1, Norm2). Using the provided FASTQs\
  and the following pipeline (Trimmomatic 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  HISAT2 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  featureCounts 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  DESeq2),\
  answer the following:\
\
questions:\
  - id: q1\
    stage: read_processing\
    text: "How many sequencing lanes were concatenated to form sample Hyp1?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
\
  - id: q2\
    stage: quality_control\
    text: "What is the library size (total read counts) for sample Hyp2?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
\
  - id: q3\
    stage: quantification\
    text: "How many genes have nonzero counts in sample Norm1?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
\
  - id: q4\
    stage: differential_expression\
    text: "How many genes are upregulated \uc0\u8805 4-fold (log2FC \u8805  2) in Hypoxia vs Normoxia with FDR < 0.01?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
\
  - id: q5\
    stage: differential_expression\
    text: "Which gene is ranked 5th by log2 fold change (most upregulated) in Hypoxia vs Normoxia?"\
    answer_type: string_exact}
