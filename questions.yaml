  You have been given human pericyte bulk RNA-seq data comparing Hypoxia vs Normoxia\
  (single-end, 4 samples: Hyp1, Hyp2, Norm1, Norm2). Using the provided FASTQs\
  and the following pipeline (Trimmomatic 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  HISAT2 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  featureCounts 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  DESeq2),\
  answer the following:\
\
questions:\
  - id: q1\
    stage: read_processing\
    text: "How many sequencing lanes were concatenated to form sample Hyp1?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
\
  - id: q2\
    stage: quality_control\
    text: "What is the library size (total read counts) for sample Hyp2?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
