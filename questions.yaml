You have been given human pericyte bulk RNA-seq data comparing Hypoxia vs Normoxia 
(single-end, 4 samples: Hyp1, Hyp2, Norm1, Norm2). Using the provided FASTQs 
and the following pipeline (Trimmomatic → HISAT2 → featureCounts → DESeq2), 
answer the following:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: read_processing
    text: "How many sequencing lanes were concatenated to form sample Hyp1?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: quality_control
    text: "What is the library size (total read counts) for sample Hyp2?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: quantification
    text: "How many genes have nonzero counts in sample Norm1?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: differential_expression
    text: "How many genes are upregulated ≥4-fold (log2FC ≥ 2) in Hypoxia vs Normoxia with FDR < 0.01?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: differential_expression
    text: "Which gene ranks 6th overall with a log2FC among the most upregulated genes in Hypoxia vs Normoxia"
    answer_type: string_exact
